Utilities
=========

PyCD attempts to provide utilities or functions that are generally useful.  *cddutils* provides utilities aimed to manipulating CD records.  For example, one can generate histograms and network diagrams from a batch of CD records.  *seq_utils* provides utilities for combining CD domain data with protein sequence data.  One important utility extracts the peptide sequence to a given domain from a .fasta file and assigns it to the domain record.  `BioPython's Seq`_ class is used to handle sequence information throughout.
