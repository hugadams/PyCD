Welcome to PyCD
===============

What's New:
----------

Finally created this site and got it hosted on git.  The `source code`_ is available for download; however, the API is not in a tractable state.  I will address this soon so that others can easily use this package.

Quick Overview:
--------------

PyCD is preliminary Python framework for performing protein domain analysis, particularly NCBI's `Conserved Domain Database`_.  This project stemmed from research at the George Washington University, the goal of which was to characterize lectin-binding domains in the purple sea urchin.  As such, it aims to provide both *scripts* and an *API* for conserved domain (CD) analysis.
