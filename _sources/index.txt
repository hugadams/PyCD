Quick Overview:
--------------

PyCD is preliminary Python framework for performing protein domain analysis, particularly NCBI's `Conserved Domain Database`_.  This project stemmed from research at the George Washington University, the goal of which was to characterize lectin-binding domains in the purple sea urchin.  As such, it aims to provide both *scripts* and an *API* for conserved domain (CD) analysis.
