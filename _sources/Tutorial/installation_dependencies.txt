Dependencies/Installation
=========================

Dependencies
------------
In its current state, PyCD requires following dependencies:

**BioPython**, **pyrecords**, **Python 2.6 or greater**

The requirement of Python 2.6 or greater is actually a dependency of pyrecords, and more particularly, the utilization of namedtuples for record keeping.  This requirement may be lifted
in later versions if the main domain storage class is replaced.


Installation
------------

For now, only the `source code`_ is available; however, because it relies on pyrecords_, I need to put together a legit pyrecords API before I can make one here.
As such, one would need to install pyrecords and manually change several paths of local directories in the sourcecode.  I will fix this soon.  Please 
checkout the getting started tutorial in the mean time to get a flavor of how the codebase works.
